### Where Can I Make Changes?

1. Add your blog post to the list of [**Student Blogs**](https://titan-programmer.github.io/blogs.html). (Please only add posts relevant to Phase 1 of the Challenge's course content.) Update the **blogs.html** file:
  > * Edit blogs.html
  > * Search for `<ul class="timelineBlog">`
  > * You'll see that blog entries are made in blocks of html between list tags: `<li>` and `</li>`.
  > * Copy a block and paste below the `<ul class="timelineBlog">` tag.
  > * Update the copied block by making appropriate changes to `<h4 class="timelineBlog-title">` and `<div class="timelineBlog-body">`. Be sure to also update the 'Added On ...' date. 
  > * Verify your blog is at the **top of the list** so they are in date order.

2. Add a paragraph to any of these three topics (topics are presented in 3 tabs next to the home tab, and are based on the 3 main topics taught in Phase 1). Each topic is associated with a question to prompt your comment. Update the **index.html** file:
  > * Learning Git ("How Useful Did You Find Git and GitHub?")
  > * Exploring AWS ("Pick One Topic On AWS and Write A Summary")
  > * Implementing CloudFormation ("What Project Would You Deploy Using CloudFormation?")
